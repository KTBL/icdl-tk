# EiKoTiger-Android

Information about the architecture can be found in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Current State

**This app is a proof-of-concept for the possibility to realize an app which implements indicators of animal well being
of multiple animal categories. Because this is only a proof-of-concept, it only provides basics and is no fully developed app.**


## Translating ICDL to JSON
The app needs the ICDL translated into JSON. Therefore, a small python script is provided. It can be found at `INSERT PATH TO SCRIPT`.
The current state of indicators can be found at `INSERT PATH TO ICDL FILES`.
